# Customer Support Data Analysis Using SQL

## Objective
Analyze support ticket data from a simulated SaaS hosting environment
to identify recurring issues, SLA violations, and customer churn risks.

## Tools Used
SQL (MySQL)

## Dataset Structure
- Customers
- Websites
- Support Tickets
- DNS Changes

## Key Analysis
- Issue trend analysis
- Resolution time measurement
- SLA breach detection
- DNS change impact investigation
- Repeat complaint detection using window functions
- Customer churn-risk identification using CTEs

## Outcome
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used for real operational analysis,
not just querying — helping identify technical failures and service bottlenecks.
